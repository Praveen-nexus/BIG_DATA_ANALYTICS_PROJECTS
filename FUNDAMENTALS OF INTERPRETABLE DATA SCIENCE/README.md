**Interpretable Machine Learning for Telecom Customer Churn Prediction: Enhancing Retention via SHAP, LIME, and Model Transparency**

1. **Engineered an interpretable churn prediction model** using logistic regression and SHAP/LIME analysis, achieving **73% accuracy** while maintaining model transparency to inform customer retention strategies for a telecom client. *(Keywords: Predictive Modeling, Logistic Regression, SHAP, Interpretability)*  

2. **Optimized feature selection pipelines** by addressing multicollinearity (e.g., creating *ad_spend_per_day_of_usage*) and applying F-score-based selection, reducing redundant variables by 30% and enhancing model efficiency. *(Keywords: Feature Engineering, Multicollinearity, Data Preprocessing)*  

3. **Led interpretability-driven insights** using SHAP values and PDP plots, identifying key churn drivers like service outages (↑25% churn risk) and discounts (↓15% churn), directly guiding targeted retention campaigns. *(Keywords: Explainable AI, SHAP, Business Strategy)*  

4. **Developed a robust preprocessing framework** by encoding categorical variables, handling null/infinity values, and validating data types, ensuring readiness for classification models. *(Keywords: Data Cleaning, Python, Classification)*  

5. **Boosted stakeholder decision-making** by translating LIME outputs into actionable strategies (e.g., optimizing discount thresholds), aligning model outcomes with telecom retention KPIs. *(Keywords: Cross-Functional Collaboration, LIME, KPI Alignment)*
