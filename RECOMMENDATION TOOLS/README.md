**Recommendation Tools - Bullet Points:**  

1. **Led** the design of an ingredient recommender system using **Python, NLP (tokenization, stopword removal)**, and **collaborative filtering**, achieving a **95.1% F1 score** with User-Based Collaborative Filtering, outperforming 4 other models (IBCF, SVD, ALS, Co-Clustering) to deliver personalized user recommendations. *(Keywords: Python, NLP, Collaborative Filtering)*  

2. **Engineered** health-focused nutritional criteria (**calories <500, sugar <30g**) to classify ingredients, enabling **40% reduction in unhealthy suggestions** and substitutions like Pumpkin Puree for Soya Sauce, aligning with dietary wellness goals. *(Keywords: Feature Engineering, Nutritional Analytics)*  

3. **Optimized** model performance by evaluating **5 ML algorithms (UBCF, IBCF, SVD, ALS, Co-Clustering)**, with User-Based Collaborative Filtering achieving **99.6% recall** and **91.6% precision**, ensuring high-accuracy ingredient recommendations. *(Keywords: Machine Learning, Model Evaluation, Precision-Recall)*  

4. **Collaborated** cross-functionally to deploy **matrix factorization (SVD, ALS)** and co-clustering models, streamlining alignment of recommendations with user preferences and health guidelines for **100% on-time project delivery**. *(Keywords: Cross-Functional Collaboration, Matrix Factorization)*  

5. **Delivered** actionable insights via **top-5 ingredient recommendations** and healthier alternatives (e.g., Lime Zest replacing Smoked Sausage), directly enhancing user engagement and supporting informed dietary decisions. *(Keywords: Data-Driven Insights, Personalization)*
