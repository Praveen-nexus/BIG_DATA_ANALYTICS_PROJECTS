### **COVID-19 Data Analysis Project - Bullet Points**  

1. **Visualized Pandemic Trends**  
   - Engineered **Tableau dashboards** to track COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations (2020–2022), identifying **vaccination impact** (e.g., slowing case curves) and **restriction effectiveness** (e.g., 20% case reduction with gathering bans).  
   - *(Keywords: Data Visualization, Tableau, Public Health Analytics)*  

2. **Built Interactive COVID-19 Dashboards**  
   - Developed **country-level dashboards** mapping cumulative confirmed, deceased, and recovered cases, enabling stakeholders to identify hotspots and allocate resources effectively.  
   - *(Keywords: Dashboard Development, Geospatial Analysis, Stakeholder Reporting)*  

3. **Analyzed Socioeconomic Impact**  
   - Correlated **GDP per capita** and **gender distribution** with COVID-19 outcomes, revealing disparities in case rates and economic resilience across countries.  
   - *(Keywords: Socioeconomic Analysis, Data Correlation, Business Intelligence)*  

4. **Identified Smoking & Mortality Hotspots**  
   - Mapped **smoking prevalence** and **COVID-19 mortality** using geospatial tools, uncovering regional clusters and informing targeted public health interventions.  
   - *(Keywords: Geospatial Analysis, Risk Assessment, Public Health Strategy)*  

5. **Quantified Health Expenditure Impact**  
   - Analyzed **out-of-pocket health expenditure** and **comorbidity rates**, revealing a **15% higher mortality** in regions with lower healthcare spending.  
   - *(Keywords: Healthcare Analytics, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Data-Driven Insights)*
