**Bullet Points:**  

1. **Led donor data preprocessing** using Python/Pandas, cleaning 20k+ records (handling missing regions/genders) and engineering 15+ features (age groups, seasonal trends), **boosting model AUC by 24%** (0.75 to 0.99) for precision targeting.  
*(Keywords: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Python, AUC)*  

2. **Engineered predictive models** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) with Scikit-learn, achieving **99% AUC** and **96% accuracy**, optimizing donor segmentation to forecast €209K in donations and reduce campaign costs by **€5.6K** (€0.80/letter).  
*(Keywords: Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, Scikit-learn, Cost Optimization)*  

3. **Designed cross-functional stakeholder reports** profiling donor demographics (30–60 age group, Flanders region dominance), enabling **25% higher engagement** in high-impact regions through data-driven campaign adjustments.  
*(Keywords: Data-Driven Insights, Stakeholder Collaboration, Demographic Analysis)*  

4. **Implemented One-Hot Encoding and Pearson’s correlation** for feature selection, identifying key predictors (region, language, donation history) to improve model precision by **18%** and reduce false positives by **15%**.  
*(Keywords: Feature Selection, Statistical Analysis, Predictive Analytics)*  

5. **Automated donor reactivation workflows** using logistic regression (96% AUC), reducing manual targeting efforts by **40%** and aligning outreach with a **30% increase** in recurring donations.
